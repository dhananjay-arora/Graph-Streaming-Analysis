# Graph-Streaming-Analysis

The goal of the project is to provide us an opportunity to explore real computational problems and develop a deep understanding of advanced data structures, for example, graph and useful techniques of applying graph data structure to solve problems in diverse application domains.

Graph data structures provide powerful representation of relational objects (or items). They naturally expressed inter-dependencies through links (or edges) between the related objects (or vertices). The multiple paths walking through related objects effectively capture their long-range correlations. Moreover, a graph representation is object-oriented and it facilitates the representation of rich datasets enabling the incorporation of not only node and edge attributes/types but also topology properties. Graph algorithms are an important component, where different algorithmic techniques can be used, for example, combinatorial optimization, linear programming, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. Network analysis and mining require the deep understanding of these network topology parameters. Many interesting questions are involved in graph data structures. In the project, we choose topics related to graph data structures with an emphasis on network topology measures and their application in dynamic network analysis, anomaly detection, and assignment/scheduling optimization.

In the project, our topics are cast into the following five categories:

Network topology characteristics

Anomaly detection in complex network

Similarity ensemble approach (SEA)

Simulation of Crayfish behavior models

Linear programming. Many graph problem can be cast to an optimization problem. Linear programming (LP) is a central topic in optimization. It can be employed to depict complex relationships through linear functions and then find the optimum points. It is a powerful tool in modeling many applications and perform optimization. In the project, we would like to emphasize the famous alignment problems.

Topics:

Network topology characteristics
The network topology properties can be measured in many different criteria. The systematical study of network topology characteristics is meaningful in graph data mining and temporal‚Äêspatial analysis and prediction in dynamic complex network systems.

Here we list popular topology properties

Node Centrality

Node centrality (node degree distribution and node weight degree distribution)

Betweenness centrality: the fraction of all shortest paths that pass through a node

Page rank centrality: the number of times that a node will be visited on a sufficiently long random walk on the graph

Path Length

Average shortest path length from a node to all other nodes. It relates to the routing hops

Diameter: longest of the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes

Effective diameter: path length that defines the 90th percentile of all paths

Community Structure

Clustering coefficient: the number of edges among the neighbors of a node as compared to the maximum possible numbers. The clustering coefficient is related to the resilience of the routing infrastructure because it reflects the number of alternative route between pairs of nodes

Degree assortativity measures whether nodes tend to connect others of similar degree

K-cores decomposition measures successive maximally connected subgraphs

Structural centrality: hierarchy from the most influential nodes to least influential nodes

Scale-free Structure

Check whether the degree distribution follows the power-law distribution

Small-world network versus scale-free network.
